# hp microserver gen10 

updates "ROM Flash Firmware Package - Server Platform Services (SPS) Firmware for HPE MicroServer Gen10 Plus
"  aka "Intelligent Provisioning" etc in-addition to bios and ilo

for some reason this can not be done from ilo, but only with this rpm extracted tool (+ lib in the same working dir (!))
